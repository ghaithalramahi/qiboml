# Qiboml

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Qiboml, the quantum machine learning package of the Qibo ecosystem!

---

ðŸŽ¯Â Our goal is to integrate Qibo within the most commonly used machine learning frameworks,
allowing the definition and usage of quantum or hybrid classical-quantum models
keeping the same high-level language proposed by the most used libraries (Pytorch, Tensorflow).
